# HTML to JPEG Converter for Anki Cards

## Overview

This tool is specifically designed to convert Anki cards from a `print.html` file into individual JPEG files. It is particularly useful for users of the [Basic Printing Support](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1025789669) plugin for Anki, which generates these `print.html` files.

## How It Works

The application uses the `html2canvas` JavaScript library to render the HTML content of each Anki card (found within `td` elements) into a canvas. This canvas is then converted into a JPEG image. Each image file is named with a "cell-" prefix, followed by a sequential number (e.g., "cell-001.jpg", "cell-002.jpg"), for easy organization and identification.

## Requirements

- A web browser compatible with HTML5 and JavaScript (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- A `print.html` file, generated by the Basic Printing Support plugin for Anki.

## Usage

1. **Open the Application**: Load the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. **Upload the File**: Use the file input to upload your `print.html` file, containing the Anki cards.
3. **Automatic Conversion**: After the file is uploaded, the application processes each Anki card in the HTML file and starts downloading the JPEG files.
4. **Retrieve Files**: The JPEG files will be downloaded to your default download folder, named with the "cell-" prefix and a sequential number (e.g., “cell-001.jpg”, “cell-002.jpg”).

## Notes

- The tool is optimized for the HTML structure typically found in Anki cards generated by the Basic Printing Support plugin.
- Ensure any external resources in the HTML comply with CORS policies to avoid loading issues.
- The application best supports basic HTML and inline CSS. Advanced styling or scripts might not render as expected.
